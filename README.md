Skype Quote Forger
==================

This is a very small application that lets you generate Skype quotes using Skype's registered clipboard format. I used "Forger" in the name because of the nature
of quotes in Skype - normally, you can't just make them up. They have to be taken from messages that were actually sent. 


With this application, you can convince your friends that they really did say that they would buy you lunch today. After all, you have a quote from them.
